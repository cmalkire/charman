Character manager to-do list

1. Reveiw classes and inherited classes to make sure that the attributes for the individual characters will work right.
2. Add in external file functionality, a way to possibly add feats + descriptions?
3. Decide which attibutes need to go where (maybe inherited classes aren't that useful here)
4. Ways to equip/unequip items?
5. Race menues and presets?
6. Might have to impliment functions in the char_info class.
7. Basic level up information, don't worry about AC or anything else, just things that change for each class.
8. Fix int locking error, perhaps a little bit of error correction code?

Notes:

-Keep in mind that we're starting in pathfinder, it's a harder numerical system anyhow
-Files are going to be important, if this is going to be used as a utility, it should be able to create either its own directories, or will need some present to work properly
-Remember that the compile command is very 
different on android, and for testing purposes 
there needs to be two different versions
